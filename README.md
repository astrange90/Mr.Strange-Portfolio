# Mr.Strange-Portfolio

## Description

Creating this portfolio and updating it with new development projects shows how far I've come. Before I got to this point I had no prior experience to coding, and took a chance on a new challenge. This portfolio in the works will be created with just the front end with React but later down the line will be a full stack application.

## Installation
Npm Create Vite to get the React package.json installed. You will need to name your folder then after pick Javascript in terminal choices to finish installing.

## Usage



To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
